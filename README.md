# MicroServicesArchitectureFrontEnd
An incomplete beginning doesn't really do anything yet...unless you want to see a bicylce animation!

The intent is to demonstrate various Microservices techniques using this front end. Consider the actions required
to make a bicycle move: peddle, change shifter, derailer moves, gear ratio changes, and the effects of each. The focus
will be on speed while ignoring the physics of force, steering etc.
